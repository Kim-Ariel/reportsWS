```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(DT)

x <- "disp"
y <- "mpg"

mod <- lm(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars)

```
The graph below displays the relationship between `r y` and `r x` in a data set of `r nrow(mtcars)` observations.

```{r}
plot(mtcars[[x]], mtcars[[y]], xlab = x, ylab = y)
```

Based on a linear model, we predict that the expected value of `r y` will increase by `r coef(mod)[[2]]` units for each one unit increase in `r x`.

The raw data is available to explore here:

```{r echo = FALSE}
datatable(mtcars)
```
